## Changes

I went to the Dragula Github and read the documentation. Following the examples, I created a Dragula object with the three containers. To handle the item color changes, I used a Drake on drop event listener. I briefly modified the swimlanes to include their name as ID, and then fetched the name in the event listener to determine which class to change the dragged object. Finally I tested the code and created the patch and documentation.
